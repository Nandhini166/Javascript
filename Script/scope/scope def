WHAT IS FUNCTION SCOPE IN JS ?
   In Js there are two types of scope:
      1..Local Scope
      2..Global Scope
    Each Function creates a new scope.
    Scope determines the accessilbility(visibility) of these variables.
    variables defined inside a function are not accessible(visible) from outside the function.
